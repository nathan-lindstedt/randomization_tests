Step 9: score/null_score, fit_reduced, batch infrastructure, backend param, batch_fit_paired

Protocol additions:
- score(model, X, y) and null_score(y, fit_intercept) on all 6 families;
  eliminates duck-typed model_fit_metric/null_fit_metric
- fit_reduced() module-level function centralising reduced-model fitting
- batch_fit_and_score() / batch_fit_and_score_varying_X() for Kennedy
  and Freedman-Lane joint strategies
- batch_fit_paired(X_batch, Y_batch) where both X and Y vary per
  replicate — JAX vmap over paired (X, y) batches

Engine + API:
- family parameter widened from str to str | ModelFamily
- backend= parameter on permutation_test_regression / PermutationEngine

Confounder optimisation:
- Bootstrap loop (1000 iters) and jackknife loop (n iters) in
  confounders.py refactored from sequential fit() to single
  batch_fit_paired() calls — order-of-magnitude speedup for
  non-linear families (ordinal, multinomial, negbin)

Fixes:
- 15 JAX solver return-type annotations corrected (2-tuple to 3-tuple)

Tests: 675 passed. mypy clean. ruff clean.

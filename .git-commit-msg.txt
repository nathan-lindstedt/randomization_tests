Step 6: Zero model_type + ModelFamily on results + self-contained display

- Delete model_type field from IndividualTestResult and JointTestResult
- Change family field from str to ModelFamily instance on both result classes
- Add _SERIALIZERS ClassVar registry to _DictAccessMixin; to_dict()
  composes serializers (family -> family.name) with _numpy_to_python()
- Add 5 new fields to both result classes: feature_names, target_name,
  n_permutations, groups, permutation_strategy
- Make display functions self-contained: print_results_table(results, *,
  title=...) extracts family/feature_names/target_name from result object
- Same for print_joint_results_table and print_diagnostics_table
- compute_standardized_coefs and compute_cooks_distance take
  family: ModelFamily instead of model_type: str
- print_confounder_table family param: ModelFamily | None (drop str)
- Update all 7 test files, 6 example files, API.md, QUICKSTART.md
- Zero model_type references in src/, tests/, examples/
- 648 passed, mypy clean, ruff clean

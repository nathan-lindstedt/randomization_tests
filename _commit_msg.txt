v0.4.1: exchangeability cells — groups=, within/between/two-stage permutations

Steps 10-11 complete:
- groups= parameter on permutation_test_regression() with within/between/two-stage strategies
- generate_within_cell_permutations() with Lehmer-code exhaustive enumeration for small cells
- generate_between_cell_permutations() with index remapping for unbalanced groups
- generate_two_stage_permutations() composing between + within
- Engine _permute_hook() dispatches based on groups/strategy/family.exchangeability_cells()
- Validation guardrails: callback validation, singleton warnings, budget checks, imbalance warnings
- Two-stage vectorization via pre-composed index arrays (no per-permutation Python loops)
- Cycling bug fix for within-cell generator with infeasible between-cell combinations
- Between-cell infeasibility validation with clear error messages

Benchmarks:
- End-to-end profiling across all 6 families and 3 strategies
- Real-world scenario profiling (clinical trial, education, manufacturing)
- Updated dedup profiling with cell generator comparisons

Housekeeping:
- Plan steps 5-11 crossed off
- ROADMAP cleaned (removed pre-v0.4.0 completed sections)
- Verify gates moved to tests/verify_gates/
- Version 0.4.1
